--- Introduction
MAYBE: Use explicit constructors to avoid implicit type conversion  

Default vs copy vs assignment constructors
Widget w1; //default
Widget w1(w2); //copy
Widget w2 = w1; //copy, this is NOT an assignment
Widget w2;
w2 = w1; //this is assignment

--- Item 2 Use consts, inline and enums over #defines 
- helps with debugging 
- allows scoping 
- only one copy of variable, fn per code 

--- Item 3 Use const whenever possible 
- use const ref for non-native C types
- const member fns help convey to user that fn will not modify object
- use mutable to modify select members (e.g. mutex, logging) in const fns 
- ALWAYS implement non-const member fn in terms of const member fn 
A.h
class A
{
   char& getText(size_t position);
   const char& getText(size_t position) const;
}
A.cpp
char& A::getText(size_t position)
{
   const char& temp = static_cast<const A*>(this)->getText;
   return const_cast<char &>temp;
}

--- Item 4 Initialize objects before they are used
- Use initialization list in constructors
- C++ initializes members in the order they were declared and NOT in the order of the initialization list so keep them both consistent

--- Item 5 Know what functions C++ silently calls
- default ctor. following only when needed - copy ctor and assignment operator
- default dtor

--- Item 6 Explicitly disallow the use of compiler generated functions you do not want
- declare constructors private e.g. boost::noncopyable but do NOT implement them

--- Item 7 IMPORTANT Declare destructors virtual in polymorphic base classes
- Any base class that contains a single virtual fn should have a virtual destructor
- This prevents partially destroyed objects
- Do not blindly declare all destructors virtual as this adds un-necessary overhead

--- Item 8 Never throw exceptions from destructors 
- This leads to numerous problems, just don't do it

--- Item 9 Never call virtual functions during construction/destruction
- Intent of virtual fn is to help derived class implement their own version. When constructing object of derived class, base class is constructed first. In the constructor Derived::Derived(), the Base::VirtualFn() will be called which is most probably not the intent. 

--- Item 10 Have assignment operators return a reference to *this 
Widget& operator=(const Widget& rhs);
- This allows chaining like x = y = z = "test string";
- Applies to other assignment operators as well like +=, -=, etc.

--- Item 11 Handle assignment to self in operator=
Widget& Widget::operator=(const Widget& rhs)
{
   if(this == &rhs) return *this;
   ...
}

--- Item 12 Copy all parts of an object
- remember to copy base class parts as well

--- Item 13 Use objects to manage resources
- when auto_ptr is copied, the copying pointer assumes sole ownership of the resource

--- Item 14 Think carefully about copying behavior in resource-mananging classes
- Prohibit copying
- OR use a reference count
- OR copy the underlying resource (deep copying)
- OR transfer ownership like auto_ptrs


--- Item 15 Provide access to raw resources 
- simplest: provide get() method
- provide implicit conversion functions using operator()
class ObjWrapper
{
   operator Obj() const
   {
      return o;
   }

private:
   Obj o;
}
ObjWrapper objW(...);
FuncThatTakesObj(objW); //objW implicitly converted to type Obj
- overload the -> and * operator 

--- Item 16 Use same form of new and delete
- if use new[] remember to use delete[]
- boost provides scoped_array and scoped_vector to auto manage this

--- Item 17 Store newed objects in smart pointers in standalone statements
- BAD example
myFunc(tr1::shared_ptr<Widget> pw, priority());
Order of execution is not guaranteed, e.g. 
Widget temp = new Widget;
priority(); //if this throws an exception, ptr returned from new will be lost 
shared_ptr<Widget> final(temp);
- GOOD example
tr1::shared_ptr<Widget> temp(new Widget);
myFunc(temp, priority())
