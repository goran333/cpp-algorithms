A simple implementation of the hashmap functionality in C that supports string (key) and int (value) pairs.

Future/TODOs
- Use a industry standard hash function like SHA1 instead of writing our own
- Current implementation does not handle collisions. Replace the array of nodes with an array of linkedlists to handle this.
