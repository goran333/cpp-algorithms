Virtual Functions: 
- non-virtual functions are resolved at compile-time aka static binding
- virtual functions are resolved at run-time aka dynamic binding
- always define a virtual destructor for the parent class

Operator overloading: 
BookShelf BookShelf::operator+(const BookShelf &other) {...}

Difference between pointers and references:
- references cannot be reassigned to another piece of memory
- references cannot be NULL they always have to be initialized using an existing object OR a free-standing reference
-- int a = 10; int &b = a; //ref to named object a
-- int &b = 12; //free standing ref to anonymous object
